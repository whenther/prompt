<div id="about"> <div class="jumbotron"> <div class="container"> <h1>Your mobile tele<span class="highlight">prompt</span>er</h1> <p>This is an app built for one purpose: scrolling text files at a steady rate. It's handy for musicians or speakers who have text that needs to zip by in a certain amount of time, but don't want to have to keep swiping at their device.</p> </div> </div> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-4"> <h2 style="color: #5cb85d">Scroll your stuff.</h2> <p>If you're a musician or a speaker, it's time to ditch the paper. Upload or paste in all your speeches, presentations, guitar tabs - anything that's saved as a text file. Add in the length of each file, and your laptop, smartphone, or tablet will be able to scroll over each file, at the speed you need.</p> </div> <div class="col-sm-4"> <h2 style="color: #efad4d">The stars, aligned.</h2> <p>Prompt is for more than just text. It's compatible with most HTML tags, including formatting tags (like strong and em) and tables, so you can style your text. And since prompt preserves line breaks and displays in a monospaced font, you can embed ASCII tabs, or align chords with words in a song.</p> </div> <div class="col-sm-4"> <h2 style="color: #b55250">Play local.</h2> <p>Sure, having your own personal teleprompter is handy. But when you're in the basement of a dive bar in the middle of nowhere, or in the middle of a packed conference, you really don't want to have to rely on a spotty internet connection. With prompt, everything is saved locally so you're good to go. </p> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"> <h2>How to get scrolling</h2> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-8"> <h3>Add text</h3> <p>First, click NEW on the nav bar to add a text file. There's some required information: <br> <em>name: </em>A memorable name, so you can find this later! <br> <em>time: </em>The time (in hrs:sec:min) to scroll your text <br> <em>body: </em>The actual text. This can include basic HTML formatting tags like p, hr, em, or strong.</p> <h3>Play text</h3> <p>Choose a file from the Prompts page and press Play. <br> <em>Play: </em>Start or continue scrolling the text from the current position. <br> <em>Pause: </em>Pause scrolling. You can continue where you left off by pressing play again. <br> <em>Top: </em>Scroll the text back to the top, ready to be played again.</p> <h3>Edit/Delete text</h3> <p>Choose a file from the Prompts page and press Edit. <br> <em>Delete: </em>Permanently delete this text. <br> <em>Save: </em>After you make any edits to the time or text, make sure to save your work!</p> </div> <div class="col-sm-4 img-container img-container-right"> <img src="images/basic.svg" alt="basic art" class="svg-icon"> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"> <h2>Advanced features</h2> <p>If you just want to load up a speech and play it, you probably don't need any of this. If you're looking to do anything more involved, like saving an entire song list or moving things between devices, read on!</p> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-4 img-container"> <img src="images/upload.svg" alt="upload art" class="svg-icon"> </div> <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-push-4"> <h3>Upload</h3> <p>The easiest way to add a file is to do it manually, pasting in the name, time, and body text. But if you want to add a bunch, that's pretty inefficient. Instead, you can upload one or more files, and each one will be saved separately, using the filenames as names. <br> <br>To do that, go to the Prompts page, press Upload, and choose any text file on your filesystem. Note that they don't have to be .txt files - anything saved as plain text, like .html or .md is fine. Anything saved in a proprietary format, like .doc or .pdf, WILL NOT WORK. <br> <br>Also, note that choosing multiple files to upload is currently not working on mobile devices. If you need to upload a few files, just do them one at a time. If you need to upload a lot, do it on a computer, and import the data (see below).</p> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-4 img-container img-container-right"> <img src="images/notes.svg" alt="notes art" class="svg-icon"> </div> <div class="col-sm-8"> <h3>Uploading Notes</h3> <p>Prompt makes it easy to embed notes in your text files. Anywhere in your text file, put "==PROMPT NOTES==" before the notes, and "==NOTES END==" after. Make sure these are each by themselves on their own lines. Inside, you can put as much text as you want, and it'll all get pulled out of the main body and into the notes section during upload. Just make sure that, if you also include a JSON block, that still comes last. </p> <p> You can include as many note blocks as you want, and each one will be separated by a horizontal line in the notes section. This makes it easy to add basic info to the top of your file, and append more notes at the bottom. </p> <p> You can also add sections that won't get imported at all during upload. To do that, just surround the skippable text with "==PROMPT SKIP==" and "==END SKIP==". </p> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-4 img-container"> <img src="images/data.svg" alt="data art" class="svg-icon"> </div> <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-push-4"> <h3>Upload Data</h3> <p>Uploading files is great, but you have to manually add times and change names to each one. To save that kind of data in your text files, you can use a special data formatting style called JSON. JSON is a format that is pretty easy for both humans and computers to read. If you'd like to learn more about it, see <a href="http://json.org/" target="_other">json.org.</a> Using it with prompt isn't that complicated though. At the VERY BOTTOM of your files, just add this text: <pre>
{
    "name": "YOUR NAME",
    "time": "1:00"
}</pre> Make sure to include the brackets and commas, and to put double quotes around all values. <br> <br>If prompt finds this at the bottom of an uploaded file, it will use the data, and the JSON won't show up in the body.</p> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-4 img-container img-container-right"> <img src="images/port.svg" alt="import-export art" class="svg-icon"> </div> <div class="col-sm-8"> <h3>Import Export</h3> <p>If you want to move your files between devices you have a couple options. If you keep everything as separate text files, you can just re-upload them on each device. To make things every easier, you can create an export file of everything, and then import that onto your other device. <br> <br>To do that, go to the Import/Export page, and click Export on the device you want to export from. This will create a prompt_export.json file. Save that file in Dropbox or Google Drive, or email it to yourself, and Import in on your second device. When import is complete, the second device will have all your stuff!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container"></div></div>
