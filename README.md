prompt
======

Your mobile teleprompter.
-------------------------
This is an app built for one purpose: 
scrolling text files at a steady rate. It's handy for musicians or speakers 
who have text that needs to zip by in a certain amount of time, but don't 
want to have to keep swiping at their device.

Technology
----------
prompt is an entirely client-side webapp, built with Angular. It uses
Bootstrap and sass for styling, and among other libraries, the excellent
[angular-scroll](https://github.com/durated/angular-scroll) for controlling
scrolling, and and my own library
[angular-ms-time](https://github.com/whenther/angular-ms-time)
for converting human-readable time to milliseconds. I used 
[PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com)
to create the Android app.
